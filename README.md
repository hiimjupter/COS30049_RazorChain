### Visual Studio Code
An integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft that supports features such as debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

### ReactJS
An open-source JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces. It is component-based and maintained by Meta Platforms and a community of individual developers and companies.

### NextJS
A React-based open-source web development framework developed by Vercel. It enables server-side rendering and static website generation for web applications.

### Chakra UI
A simple, modular, and accessible component library that provides the building blocks for constructing React applications.

### Thirdweb
An all-in-one platform that facilitates the easy transition of ideas onto web3. It provides services such as deploying, interacting with, and managing Smart Contracts on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Metamask
A web-based cryptocurrency wallet used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Ethereum Testnet – Sepolia Network
One of several test networks available for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows developers to test and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) without risking actual funds or affecting the main network.

### Solidity
An object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

### GitHub & Git
